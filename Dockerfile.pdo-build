# Description:
#   Build Private Data Objects.
#
#  Configuration (build) paramaters
#  - proxy configuration: 		https_proxy http_proxy ftp_proxy  (default: undefined)
#  - base image with pdo dev environ: 	PDO_DEV_IMAGE (default: pdo-dev)
#    (presumably built from Dockerfile.pde-dev)

# Build:
#   $ docker build docker -f docker/Dockerfile.pdo-dev -t pdo-build
#   if behind a proxy, you might want to add also below options
#   --build-arg https_proxy=$https_proxy --build-arg http_proxy=$http_proxy --build-arg ftp_proxy=$ftp_proxy
#   if you want to build with different version than , add a build arg PDO_DEV_IMAGE e.g., --build-arg PDO_DEV_IMAGE=pdo-build-xenial
#
# Run:
#   $ cd PrivateDataObjects
#   $ docker run -it pdo-build /bin/bash
#   Notes: 
#   - this is built intrinsically in simulator mode (see below), so no point in passing SGX device
#     and daemon pipe (as possible in images built from base dev image Dockerfile.pdo-dev)
#   - if behind a proxy, you might want to add also below options
#     --env https_proxy=$https_proxy --env http_proxy=$http_proxy --env ftp_proxy=$ftp_proxy
#

# TODO: 
# - wecannot pass driver/daemon pipe to build. So detection logic from ~/.bashrc doesn't work for build.
#   furthermore, common build (and others do automatically call test programs which fail when built in HW-mode
#   as no SGX support during build.  To handle that, not only would we have to pass a build parameter to define
#   SGX_MODE but we also would have to refactor build process. For now hardcode SIM for build _and_ subsequent run ...
# - tests create huge file which makes docker fail in building image. currently above manually
# cleans up the file but ideally make would do that itself (or at least offer make test-clean target or alike)
